## The Journey of Learning ML

> A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Defining the process of learning is challenging, but we realize that learning is what shapes us. We learn, and we evolve, ultimately becoming ourselves.

Our journey toward self-discovery commences from the moment of our birth as infants, persisting until our last breath. Reflecting upon the most profound question of existence - "Who am I?" - my immediate realization is that we are shaped by our experiences. Though we may share a commonality as human beings, our uniqueness lies in the diversity of our experiences.

I firmly believe that through diligent studies of machine learning and the exploration of more data on our experiences, we will unveil additional answers.

This conviction propels me onto the path of machine learning, aiming to comprehend our existence better and delve into the intricacies of our thought mechanisms.
